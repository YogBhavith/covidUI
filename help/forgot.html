Forgot Password is used to re-create the password of an existing user account. So, if you are the first user of this application 
after istallation, then you may get an error saying <i>No Users Found! Go to 'Register New User' in 'Admin' menu to Register 
First User</i> as shown in the picture below. So if you are the first user, then register yourself first as specified in the error message.
