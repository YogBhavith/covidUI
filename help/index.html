<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;color:white;text-align:center;">Welcome to COVID-19 Application Help</h1>

<h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">About the Application</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Covid-19 application is a standalone application which can be installed on a personal PC and Maintain the COVID-19 Data state-wise
with the help of one or more administrators. Only Administrators can add new data of a new state or update the data of an existing state 
or can also delete the data of a state all-together.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
New administors can be added only with the permission of an Exisitng Administrator (Other Admin's login credentials needed). How ever,
any Admin acount can be deleted at any time, only by providing exiting login credentials. If an Admin forgot his password, he/she may 
try to re-create password through forgot password, or delete himself/herself from database and create another account with the help of 
other Admin's credetials.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
All the data that is saved from the application, i.e., States' COVID-19 data and also User login credentials data, is stored in the 
file format using the pipeline concept. The data is retrived from the file when prompted by the application using the concept of 
split string in C++. The complete code of the application was programmed in Win32 C++ environment in Dev C++ IDE.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This application wouldn't have been possible without the help I got from the websites cited below. My sincere gratitude goes 
to the creaters of these forums and websites and also to the people who took their valuable time out for answering the queries 
posted on these blogs, helping us create beautiful applications with much less effort. I also extend my thanks to the author 
of the book Programming Windows (5th Edition), Mr. Charles Petzold, for such an amazing book on the area which is untouched 
by most of the people due its complexity.

Creating this application created a huge opportunity for me in learning C++ based Win32 environment, on which, not much 
of information is available on the internet. This application was created as a part of my mini-project during my leasure 
hours, as I like Coding as a hobby. If any interested individual is looking for a Win32 project based on C++ (Without Forms, 
MFC, QT, or VS) and is willing to learn some basics, I welcome you on to my google drive link where I will be sharing my 
complete project for downloading.
