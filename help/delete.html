after istallation, then you get an error saying <i>No Users Found! Go to 'Register New User' in 'Admin' menu to Register 
First User</i> as shown in the picture below. So if you are the first user, register yourself first as specified in the error message.

To delete an existing User from the database, approval by an existing user's login credentials is required. You can enter the credentials of 
any other user for approval or may also enter the same user's credentials whose account has to be deleted (As till deletion the user is still 
an approved admin). Once the login is successfull, a window as shown in below image pops up.
