<h3>Register First User</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Registering an admin user is the first thing you want to do after installing the app, as you need admin user credentials to add, delete or update 
data of COVID-19 in the database. As a first time user, you can directly register your account by entering your username and password 
as shown in the below image. After Register is clicked, it gives a message saying <i>New user registration successful!</i>. Make sure 
to enter both <b>Enter Password</b> and <b>Re-Enter Password</b> match.

<h3>Register Next New Users</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Once the first user is registered, next new user registrations are to be uproved by any of the existing users. So, once the <b>Register 
New User</b> is clicked, a Login window pops up asking for the existing user's credentials as shown in the below image.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Once the proper login credentials are given and clicked on login button, a <i>Login Success</i> message pops up and directs to Register 
New User window after closing the pop-up. From here the process of new user registration follows the 'Register First User' method.
